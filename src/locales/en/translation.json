    "introduction1": "<p>I'm Hester and I have been making handbags and accessories in leather for more than 10 years. During that time I developed a preference for vegetable tanned leather. My collection of handbags was inspired by this honest and sustainable material. I make the bags that I want myself... nice leather, few shiny haberdashery and easy to use. Preferably with an extra detail that makes you happy. And you can see this in the colored magnets that appear in my models.</p><p>If you wish to order a handbag, this is done by email to me. This way you can choose a number of features yourself, such as the colors of the details and haberdashery, the construction of the shoulder strap and its length.</p><p>For me, personal contact is important. I like to know where my bag will end up and who I'm making it for.</p>",
    "introduction2": "<p>If you have any questions, send me a message and I will contact you. If you would like to come and have a look in my studio, this is possible by appointment.</p><p>I live with Jimmy and our 3 cats in Rosmeer. In addition to working in my studio, I teach at Cursa, where you can follow the four-year leather worker course. I also work part-time at CC Lanaken where I program youth performances and classical concerts, among other things. I love music, visiting cities, cooking for friends and family and good food.</p><br><p>See you soon,<br>Hester</p><br><p>P.S. When I'm at work I don't always answer the phone. Leave a message and I will call you back.</p>"
