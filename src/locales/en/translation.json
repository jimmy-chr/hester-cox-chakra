    "veg-tan-description": "<p>My choice for vegetable tanned leather is a choice for leather that 'lives', that develops its own patina over the years. In this way, my handbags carry your own story with them over time. This is in contrast to leather in which the characteristic features are concealed by a (thick) layer of paint that slowly wears off.</p><p>First of all, there are a number of properties of this leather that you should take into account. Vegetable tanned leather feels warm and allows all the natural properties of the skin to be visible. The colours are influenced by the outside. Only choose this leather and you know that with use the colour of your bag will change and become warmer. The bright fresh colours deepen and become less pronounced.</p><p>This beautiful leather is a luxury product for the enthusiast, as only 10 percent of all skins qualify for this. Vegetable tanning agents are used for the tanning process, non-toxic and not harmful to the environment. Because the paint penetrates the leather completely, you do not have a thick covering layer of paint that conceals all the properties of the material. On the contrary, due to the dyeing method, you can also see the wrinkles, scars and possible color differences and small imperfections in this leather. It is a conscious choice to work with this and to express these characteristic properties in every handbag.</p><p>My choice for vegetable tanned leather leads to extra attention for the maintenance of your bag. Please note that small scratches and spots can occur with this leather, this is part of the properties of the leather. The leather will also discolor and darken over time. Because the leather does not have a heavy finish, it is also more sensitive to water. After contact with water, carefully pat the bag dry with a soft cloth and let it dry at room temperature, but above all ensure good protection against the rain.</p><p>I only work with cowhide for my handbags and not with exotic leathers. The leather is of European origin and only comes from hides that are the residual product of the meat industry. The leather of this handbag carries a quality label that stands for craftsmanship and durability.</p>",
    "care-maintenance-title": "CARE AND MAINTENANCE",
    "care-maintenance-item1": "Treat the leather against rain before use and let it dry for 12 to 24 hours. Choose a spray with nanotechnology. Repeat this every 3 to 6 months",
    "care-maintenance-item2": "Regularly treat your handbag with a nourishing cream or leather milk such as Saphir Crème Universelle. Let it soak in well and then rub. When the bag feels dry again, spray it again against rain",
    "care-maintenance-item3": "Take care of your handbag and do not overfill it",
    "care-maintenance-item4": "Be careful with grease, perfume or hand gel",
    "care-maintenance-item5": "Avoid contact between dark clothing and light-coloured leather and between dark leather and light-coloured clothing, to prevent colour transfer",
    "care-maintenance-item6": "Do not expose the bag to direct sunlight or heat to prevent the leather from fading or discolouring",
    "care-maintenance-item7": "When not in use, store your handbag in a cloth bag away from light"

  "about-me": {
    "title": "The creator",
    "introduction1": "<p>I'm Hester and I have been making handbags and accessories in leather for more than 10 years. During that time I developed a preference for vegetable tanned leather. My collection of handbags was inspired by this honest and sustainable material. I make the bags that I want myself... nice leather, few shiny haberdashery and easy to use. Preferably with an extra detail that makes you happy. And you can see this in the colored magnets that appear in my models.</p><p>If you wish to order a handbag, this is done by email to me. This way you can choose a number of features yourself, such as the colors of the details and haberdashery, the construction of the shoulder strap and its length.</p><p>For me, personal contact is important. I like to know where my bag will end up and who I'm making it for.</p>",
    "introduction2": "<p>If you have any questions, send me a message and I will contact you. If you would like to come and have a look in my studio, this is possible by appointment.</p><p>I live with Jimmy and our 3 cats in Rosmeer. In addition to working in my studio, I teach at Cursa, where you can follow the four-year leather worker course. I also work part-time at CC Lanaken where I program youth performances and classical concerts, among other things. I love music, visiting cities, cooking for friends and family and good food.</p><br><p>See you soon,<br>Hester</p><br><p>P.S. When I'm at work I don't always answer the phone.
